## Overview
Our car is built on an RC structure featuring four wheels and a rear-wheel drive system. It is powered by a DC motor that controls the wheels and a servo motor for steering. The car is equipped with three ultrasonic sensors , gyroscope and a RGB color sensor to ensure it stays on the right path.

On the second level of the structure, we have placed the Arduino controller and the Raspberry Pi, along with a 12-volt battery down in the first floor, a camera, and other components that will be detailed in the parts section.
